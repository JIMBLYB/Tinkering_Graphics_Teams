# Aim
This is a program that will take an _**input image**_ and _**create 8 new images**_ simulating what the input image would look like to people with certain color blindnesses.
### Current Outputs
The output images are named: "_img_" + type of colorblindness and are saved as a .jpg image file.
The colorblindnesses currently represented are
* Protanopia
* Protanomaly
* Deutaranopia
* Deutaranomaly
* Tritanopia
* Tritanomaly
* Achromatopsia
* Achromatanomaly
## Usage
Put an image named "_pic.jpg_" into the same directory as the python script, then run the script. If it worked then it should open a pygame window with the image you saved shown on it. The output images are saved to the same directory as the original image
