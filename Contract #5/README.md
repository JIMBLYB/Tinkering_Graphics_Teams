# Aim
This is a program that will take an _**input image**_ and _**create 8 new images**_ simulating what the input image would look like to people with certain color blindnesses.
### Current Outputs
The output images are named: "_img\__" + type of colorblindness and are saved as a .jpg image file.
The colorblindnesses currently represented are
* Protanopia
* Protanomaly
* Deutaranopia
* Deutaranomaly
* Tritanopia
* Tritanomaly
* Achromatopsia
* Achromatanomaly
## Setup
The project **requires** the **pygame** module installed on whichever environment you run this on
## Usage
Put an image named "_pic.jpg_" into the same directory as the python script, then run the script. There is a default 'pic.jpg', that will need to be saved over if you want to use your own image. If it worked then it should open a pygame window with the image you saved shown on it. The output images are saved to the same directory as the original image

Colour matrix used is from an [_**archived website**_](http://www.nofunc.com/Color_Blindness_Library/), but I used [_**Wayback Machine**_](http://web.archive.org/web/20081014161121/http://www.colorjack.com/labs/colormatrix/) to find the correct website.
