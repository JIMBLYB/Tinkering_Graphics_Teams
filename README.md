[Link to main repository.](https://github.com/JIMBLYB/Tinkering_Graphics_Teams)

## Python Code for Adjusting Graphics
This repositiory is a collection of multiple projects as part of the COM120 module at Falmouth University. The contracts attempted currently are _Platformer Tile Generator_ by Ethan Jones, _Platform Level Generator_ by Kalvin, _Platformer Entity Generator_ by Oskar Korpysa_Platformer, Entity Reskinning_ by Joe, and _Colour Blindness User Interface Analysis Tool_ by James. Pair programming was practiced where appropriate

## Instructions

### Platform Level Generator - Contract 2, Kalvin Malloch
The user must open both scripts and import pygame. When they run the LevelGeneration script, they will be prompted to input a width and height of the level. Do so, and then the level will open in a new window.

### Platformer Entity Reskinning - Contract 3, Joseph Broughton
The sprite you want to edit must be in the folder with the script, once this is done edit the script to have the sprites name and file type in the my_sprite variable. To change the colours you edit the numbers in the entity_colour_change function, this will now run and save the new sprite to the folder.

### Colour Blindness User Interface Analysis Tool - Contract 5, James Berry
Download the file and place an image in the same directory, rename this image to "image.jpg". Then run the program, once a window showing your original image the process is finished, all of the new images are saved in the same directory as the original image with names denoting what type of color blindness they are simulating.
